-- What is HTTP(Hyper-text Transfer Protocol)?
  -- HTTP is STATELESS Protocol
  -- HTTP is basically a request response protocol that means when ever a web-client needs to do some operation
	on a resource like reading,updating...
     > The web client first establishes a connection with webserver where the file is hosted then the webclient sends
  	 requests to it
     > The request contains the details what the web client wants like which operation it wants to do
     > When a web server receives and request it responds with a response back to the client and the 
    	 content of the response depends on what was requested for.
     > Example:- If a client ask to read a resource then server can either put the resource in the response or if the resource 
	 	    is not available then reponds with the resource is not available.
     > After the response is given back to the client the connection is closed and the webserver does not remember anything 
	 about the past connections who the clients were that means another time if client send another request to the server 
	 web server will treat that request as a new request coming from a new web client because of this nature HTTP protocol 
	 is also called as STATELESS Protocol
   -- This one pair of request and response is called an http transaction.
