-- INJECTION --

What is it?

- When Untrusted Data is taken from user input and applied to some kind of query or interpreter
   in a way that assumes what the data will look like

- An attacker enters the data that does not fit the expected input but malforms it in some way to 
   have unintended consequences such as error leakage,damage to data or exposure of data

- An attacker can bypass any kind of client-side controls that might be intended to stop this
	
- Usually related to SQL but can also apply to LDAP or operating system calls or anything that builds 
    a query from user input
