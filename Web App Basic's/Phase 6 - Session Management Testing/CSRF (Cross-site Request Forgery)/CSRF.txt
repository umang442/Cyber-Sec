  		   					      --- What is CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)---

 > Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to       perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.




  							      --- How Does CSRF Work? ---

 > For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:

 1 - A relevant action. There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying               permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).

 2 - Cookie-based session handling. Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the       user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

 3 - No unpredictable request parameters. The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For            example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.



 >  For example, suppose an application contains a function that lets the user change the email address on their account. When a user performs this action, they make an        HTTP request like the following:

	POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
	Host: vulnerable-website.com
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	Content-Length: 30
	Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE
